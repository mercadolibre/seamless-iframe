# Seamless Iframe

A fallback that emulates the main features of the seamless iframe.

## How it works

> "The browser should render the frame in a way that makes **it appear to be part of the containing document**."

Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes

## Demo
[See it in action](http://mercadolibre.github.io/seamless-iframe/)

## Features

*Seamless iframe* will:

- open any anchor in the parent, unless you specify otherwise,
- inherit the CSS declarations from the parent,
- behave as block element, adjusting its size to its content.

## Change log
